# Madhava Series

The 14th century Indian mathematician [Madhava of Sangaamagrama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madhava_of_Sangamagrama) discovered an [infinite series to approximate π](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madhava_series).

This script contstucts a list of the first N partial sums in this series.

It also calculates the difference between π and the result of the approximation in order to demonstrate how the accuracy of the approximation increases with the number of terms.
